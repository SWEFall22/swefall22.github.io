				<h2>Computer Science Curriculum</h2>

				<h3>Mission</h3>

				<p>
						Computer Science studies the design of computational processes,
						computing systems, and virtual objects.</p>

				<p>
						The Colby Department of Computer Science is committed to making
						computer science an integral part of a liberal arts education. Our
						goal is to provide Colby students with a strong background in computer
						science, including the integration of knowledge from other
						disciplines. Our graduates will have the ability and experience to
						enable and produce new and innovative discoveries.</p>

				<p>
						The Department of Computer Science has the broader goal of enabling
						computational thinking throughout the college community. Computational
						thinking is the ability to decompose a problem or process and describe
						it at the level of computable operations. Computational thinking
						integrates abstraction, hierarchical design, information management,
						and an understanding of complexity.</p>

				<h3>Objectives</h3>

				<p><i>Objectives are broad statements that describe the career and
						professional accomplishments that the program is preparing graduates
						to achieve.</i></p>

				<p>
						We expect that graduates of the Colby Computer Science program will
						</p><ul>
								<li>exhibit the ability to learn and apply new concepts and adapt to new technologies and challenges,</li>
								<li> seek out opportunities for continuing education and intellectual engagement, and</li>
								<li> become leaders and innovators in their chosen professions.</li>
						</ul>
				<p></p>

				<h3>Outcomes</h3>

				<p><i>Outcomes relate to the skills, knowledge, and behaviors that
						students acquire through courses and degree programs.</i></p>

				<p>
						Graduates of Colby College with a major in computer science will possess
						</p><ol>
								<li>proficiency in computational thinking,</li>
								<li>the ability to analyze systems at the three levels of computer science: theory, software, and hardware,</li>
								<li>proficiency in the design and implementation of algorithms using multiple programming languages,</li>
								<li>the ability to apply computational thinking to a diverse set of problems and disciplines,</li>
								<li>the ability to communicate effectively and collaborate with others, and</li>
								<li>the ability to adapt to new challenges and computational environments.</li>
						</ol>
				<p></p>

				</ul>


				<p>
						Students with a variety of interests may want to explore Computer Science, as it impacts and interacts with virtually every discipline. Many advances in the natural and social sciences, engineering, and the humanities would not have been possible without the exponential growth in computing power and the corresponding design of advanced algorithms by computer scientists. Students who become majors or minors, or take just a few courses, will expand their possibilities by knowing more about how to effectively use computers and computation.</p>

				<p>
						Computer science offers a major in CS, a minor in CS, a minor in Data Science, and five	interdisciplinary computing majors: IC-Theater, IC-Music,	Environmental Computation, Computational Biology, and Computational Psychology. The interdisciplinary majors are designed to give students depth in both computer science and their focus discipline, preparing them for careers or interdisciplinary graduate programs with a computational focus, such as digital media, geographic information systems, and bioinformatics, computational neuroscience, or computational biology.
				</p>

				<p>The initial sequence of	CS courses (CS {151, 152, or 153}, CS 231, and CS 251/2) also complements many disciplines. Whether you are an artist or a biology major, you will benefit by knowing more about how to apply computing to you area of interest. The first CS course for most students will be CS 151, 152, or 153 Computational Thinking. Students with significant programming experience should speak with a professor about taking a placement exam and potentially starting with CS 231.
				</p>

				<p>Students may count only CS 15X, CS 231, and CS 251/2 toward a CS major or minor and any Interdisciplinary major. CS majors or minors may not also obtain a minor in Data Science.  CS majors, IC majors, or CS minors interested in Data Science should complete a Statistics minor.  Mathematics or Statistics majors interested in Data Science should complete a CS minor.
				</p>

				<a name="cs-major">
						<h3>Major in Computer Science</h3></a>

				<p>
						The major in computer science is designed to prepare students for either graduate study or a career in a computation-related field. Colby CS majors have been successful in a wide variety of career paths.</p>

				<p>Students planning to attend graduate school in CS should strongly consider taking CS 376 and CS 378, undertaking an honors project, and strengthening their math background beyond the minimum required.</p>

				<ul>
						<p>Core Requirements</p>
						<ul>
								<li>CS 15X Computational Thinking</li>
								<li>CS 231 Data Structures and Algorithms</li>
								<li>CS 232 Computer Organization</li>
								<li>CS 251 Data Analysis and Visualization or CS252 Mathematical Data Analysis and Visualization</li>
								<li>CS 333 Programming Languages</li>
								<li>One of CS 375 Analysis of Algorithms, CS 376 Algorithm Analysis and Design, or CS 378 Theory of Computation</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Electives</p>
						<ul>
								<li>In addition to the core, one CS course at the 200 level or higher and three CS courses at the 300 level or higher.</li>
								<li>At least two of the four electives must be part of a two-semester sequence, finishing with a 400-level course.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Math/Statistics Requirement</p>
						<ul>
								<li>A 200-level mathematics or statistics course.
                                </li><li>Students must complete their math requirement prior to taking CS 375.
                                </li><li>MA 274 is a pre-requisite for CS 376 and CS 378. 
                                </li><li>MA 253 is a pre-requisite for CS 252.</li>
						</ul>
				</ul>

				<p>
						Interested students should look at the <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.colby.edu/inc/csmajortimelines.pdf"> example CS Major timelines</a>. As is apparent from the timelines,	taking a CS 15X course in your first year is strongly recommended.  Students can take only one of the CS 15X courses.  CS 151, 152, and 153 all satisfy a Q (Quantitative) requirement for graduation, in addition to providing an introduction to the fundamental concepts of computer science.</p>

				<a name="cs-ai">
						<h3>Major in Computer Science with a Concentration in Artificial Intelligence</h3></a>

				<p>
						The Computer Science major with a concentration in Artificial Intelligence prepares students for graduate work or careers as tool builders in AI. 
				</p><ul>
						<li>Computer Science Core: identical to the Core Requirements for the CS Major
						</li>
						<li>Artificial Intelligence Math: one of
							<ul>
								<li>MA 253, in which case students should take CS 252, <i>or</i></li>
								<li>MA 274, in which case students may take CS 252 or CS 251</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Artificial Intelligence Core
							<ul>
								<li>CS 310</li>
								<li>Neural Networks (i.e. CS 343 at Colby)</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>Artificial Intelligence Sequence: One of the following sequences:
							<ul>
								<li>Simulation: CS 346, CS 446</li>
								<li>Interactive Systems: CS 353, CS 453</li>
								<li>Neural Networks: CS 343, CS 443 (but if this is the sequence, either CS 321, CS 346, CS 353, or an AI course from abroad must also be taken to satisfy the AI Core requirement)</li>
								<li>Other AI sequences by permission of the faculty</li>
							</ul>
						</li>

					<p>Note to students planning to study abroad. If you take a neural networks course abroad (e.g. a course at DIS), then it will fulfill the core neural networks requirement, but it will not serve as a pre-req for CS443 at Colby. That means you may take neural networks abroad (assuming the specific course is OK'd by the department), and then take CS343 and CS443 here.

						<h3>Honors in Computer Science</h3></a>

				<p>
						Honors in computer science is for students who wish to pursue a topic
						more deeply than may be available in their regular coursework. Honors
						projects can be significant software projects or research in some area
						of computer science. Projects that have applications in or ties to
						other disciplines at Colby are strongly encouraged.</p>

				<p>
						Students who with to pursue honors must have a grade point average of
						3.6 in all computer science courses numbered 200 or higher and
						discuss potential projects with a CS advisor in the spring of their
						junior year.</p>

				<p>
						The honors project itself consists of two semesters of independent
						study (CS 483-484), culminating in both a written paper and a
						colloquium presentation. Students who successfully complete the
						requirements and receive the recommendation of the department will
						graduate "With Honors in Computer Science".</p>

						<h3>Independent Study in Computer Science</h3></a>

				<p>
						An independent study is a course in which a student conducts an independent project under the direction of a faculty sponsor. Independent studies are typically part of a faculty research project or a student honors project. If you are interested in an independent study, please read <a target="_blank" href="https://cs.colby.edu/inc/guideToIndependentStudiesInCS.pdf">this document</a> and contact a faculty member to begin a discussion.</p>

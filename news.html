			<li><b>Student Proposes Conference Panel, Wins Scholarship, Fall 2009</b>

			<p>Senior computer science and biology double major Olena Marchenko will be representing Colby at the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing this fall. She and Manasi Vartak (a student at WPI) proposed a panel discussion on computational biology featuring professors Anne Condon (U. British Columbia), Nancy Amato (Texas A &amp; M), and Stephanie Taylor (Colby College). The proposal was accepted, and will, consequently, bring an important topic into the spotlight at a conference with over 1400 attendees.</p>

			<p>Lena was also one of 134 (out of over 900) applicants awarded a scholarship to attend the conference. She and Professor Taylor will travel to Tuscon the last week of September.</p>

			<li><b>2009 Jan-Plan on 2D Video Game Design</b>

			<p>
			CS will be offering a Jan-plan option in 2009. Professor Maxwell will

			students with CS backgrounds and students without programming
			experience in creative teams to design a game during the 4 week
			Jan-plan semester.</p></li>

			<li><b>2008 Summer Student Projects</b>

			<p>
			Professor Maxwell will be working with six CS students in the summer
			of 2008 on four different research projects.  The projects include
			designing both a vision system and a human-robot interaction system
			for a humanoid robot, developing remote robotic biology experiments in
			the Colby woods, visual analysis of bacterial colonies, and the
			integration of animal tracking and observation data with a GIS system.
			</p></li>

			<li><b>Object-Oriented Design in Java, by Dale Skrien</b>

			<p>
			Professor Dale Skrien published a new textbook
			<a href="http://catalogs.mhhe.com/mhhe/viewProductDetails.do?isbn=0072974168">
			Object-Oriented Design Using Java</a> in January of 2008.  Dale's
			students get the contents straight from the source when Dale teaches
			his Object-Oriented Design course.  In the spring of 2008, the
			students designed a full-featured solitaire system with several
			different versions of solitaire. The students learned the value of
			the principles of good software design, such as using abstraction,
			encapsulation, strong cohesion,
			weak coupling, coding to interfaces, avoiding duplication, separating
			responsibilities, and designing for change.  If they followed these
			guidelines, then it was easy for the students to add features to
			the system.</p></li>

			<li>
			<b>Curriculum Revision</b>

			<p>
			We've completed a revision of the <a href="http://department-curriculum.php/">
			CS curriculum</a>. New aspects of the curriculum include a core course in
			data analysis and visualization, and the requirement that all majors take
			a fall-spring sequence of upper level electives. Each year we'll be offering
			a different fall spring sequence. For 2008-09, the sequence will be computer
			graphics and 3D video game design. For 2009-10, the sequence will focus on
			modeling biological systems computationally.</p>

			<p>
			The new minor is designed to integrate CS more closely with a
			student's major. For example, minors have the option of undertaking a
			capstone project that integrates with a course in their major field.

			</p><p>
			As part of the curriculum change, we are using Python as the language
			for the first course in place of Java. Students who want to TA for
			CS151 in the fall semester will need to know/learn Python. </p>

			<p>
			<a href="http://python.org/">Python.org</a> is a great place to
			start. There is also a
			<a href="https://cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/python/doc">
			list of filtered tutorials</a> for both programmers and non-programmers.

			Bruce Maxwell, Associate Professor and Chair</p>

			<p>
			Bruce comes to us from Swarthmore College, where he has been teaching
			computer science and computer engineering. His research interests
			include robotics, computer vision, and computer graphics. So don't be
			surprised this fall if you see robots gliding up and down the hall on
			the 4th floor of Mudd. Some of them might even offer you a snack</p>

			Scott Russell, Visiting Assistant Professor</p>

			<p>
			Scott joins us from Boston University, where he recently finished his
			Ph.D. on Cryptography. So when the robots start talking with one
			another, you won't be able to break into their conversation.</p>
